# Hello World!
This site is not going to be updated often, actually, assume that everything that you'll read here is horribly out of date.
Do the [Nodejs Knowledge Challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/before-you-bury-yourself-in-packages-learn-the-node-js-runtime-itself-f9031fbd8b69) or [follow my progress](/nodejs-knowledge-challenge). I am also [jotting down](/js-basics) what I'm learning about JS to answer the questions. If you read something that seems weird or that I might have gotten wrong, don't be scared to create an educational PR explaining what I misunderstood.

## About me
I am a (web)developer by profession, hobby guitarist and selective pc gamer in my sparetime. Check out my musical musings [here](https://soundcloud.com/shachath_swe/).

During my professional years so far, I've encountered the regular webdevelopement tools like HTML, CSS and JS, but also Ruby (and Rails), NodeJS and most lately, EPiServer (C# and .NET).

In my spare time however, I find myself moving towards languages like C++ and Rust. I've also dabbled a bit in Python and image recognition, if you also want to dive into the subjetct, I found these youtube playlists extremely helpful for getting started:
* [Image Recognition] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDffXBfcH9ZJuvctJV3OtB8A)
* [OpenCV with Python for Image and Video Analysis] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdttJXlLtAJxJetJcqmqlQq)

## Weapons of choice
* "I can see clearly now the rain is gone." ~ Johnny Nash. There is only one editor and it's called Emacs. All hail the mighty Stallman! You can find my completely unstructured config [here](https://github.com/beanilsson/emacs_config). I am currently working on getting [Indium](https://github.com/NicolasPetton/Indium) to play nicely.
* Vagrant is basically the Emacs of dev environments. Nothing more to say.

## Blog posts
* [Mobprogramming, observations (SWE)](http://dev.mittmedia.se/team/blogging/writer/mobbprogrammering/2017/01/13/mobbprogrammering.html)

## Crystal Lang guide
I started writing a guide as a source for my own learning. Feel free to check it out [here](./crystal_lang_guide/docs/index.md).

## Notes on flex and bison
I like to write while learning, apparently ... These [notes](https://beanilsson.github.io/flex_and_bison/) are showcasing my progress learning to use flex and bison.
