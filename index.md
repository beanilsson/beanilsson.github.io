# Hello World!
This site is not going to be updated often, actually, assume that everything that you'll read here is horribly out of date.

## About me
I am a webdeveloper by profession, hobby guitarist and selective pc gamer in my sparetime. Check out my musical musings [here](https://soundcloud.com/shachath_swe/).
For the last two years I've been programming Ruby on Rails, and while you can say alot about the Rails framework and the slugishness of Ruby compared to other languages, I've come to embrace the mentality of RoR. Keeping my copy of Sandi Metz's [Practical Object Oriented-Design in Ruby](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Practical+Object+Oriented-Design+in+Ruby) on an altar in the middle of my livingroom. (Read in an overcrowded bookshelf beneath a copy of C++ How to Program and a book about database technics.) Therefore I guess it's not a surprise that I'm half-heartedly following the [Crystal Lang](https://crystal-lang.org/) project.

I am currently learning Python as a step towards learning about Image Recognition as I find it and extremely fascinating as well as scary field, keep your enemies close right? Oh didn't I mention that I have an extremely thick tin foil hat?

## Weapons of choice
* "I can see clearly now the rain is gone." ~ Johnny Nash. There is only one editor and it's called Emacs. All hail the mighty Stallman! You can find my completely unstructured config [here](https://github.com/beanilsson/emacs_config). I am currently working on getting [Indium](https://github.com/NicolasPetton/Indium) to play nicely.
* Vagrant is basically the Emacs of dev environments. Nothing more to say.
